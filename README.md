## Plot of Natural Disasters by Death Toll

This scatterplot shows the deadliest natural disasters of the 20th and 21st centuries, showing when each event happened (horizontal/x axis) and roughly how many people lost their lives (vertical/y axis). Every point on the plot represents a disaster, and its color indicates the type.

The dotâ€™s position shows its year and death toll. The deadliest event is a flood in 1930s, which causes over 2 million deaths. Most disasters are near the bottom of the chart (under 100000 deaths), showing that most catastrophic tolls are relatively rare. Especially in recent decades, the large death tolls become less frequent, demonstrating better systems, infrastructure, and emergency response.
